@brief glTF converter plugin
@m_since_latest_{plugins}

Exports full scenes to either `*.gltf` files with an external `*.bin` buffer or
to a self-contained `*.glb`. You can use @ref GltfImporter to import scenes in
this format.

@section Trade-GltfSceneConverter-usage Usage

@m_class{m-note m-success}

@par
    This class is a plugin that's meant to be dynamically loaded and used
    through the base @ref AbstractSceneConverter interface. See its
    documentation for introduction and usage examples.

This plugin depends on the @ref Trade library and is built if
`WITH_GLTFSCENECONVERTER` is enabled when building Magnum Plugins. To use as
a dynamic plugin, load @cpp "GltfSceneConverter" @ce via
@ref Corrade::PluginManager::Manager.

Additionally, if you're using Magnum as a CMake subproject, bundle the
[magnum-plugins repository](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins) and do the
following:

@code{.cmake}
set(WITH_GLTFSCENECONVERTER ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(magnum-plugins EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# So the dynamically loaded plugin gets built implicitly
add_dependencies(your-app MagnumPlugins::GltfSceneConverter)
@endcode

To use as a static plugin or as a dependency of another plugin with CMake, put
[FindMagnumPlugins.cmake](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins/blob/master/modules/FindMagnumPlugins.cmake)
into your `modules/` directory, request the `GltfSceneConverter` component of
the `MagnumPlugins` package and link to the
`MagnumPlugins::GltfSceneConverter` target:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(MagnumPlugins REQUIRED GltfSceneConverter)

# ...
target_link_libraries(your-app PRIVATE MagnumPlugins::GltfSceneConverter)
@endcode

See @ref building-plugins, @ref cmake-plugins, @ref plugins and
@ref file-formats for more information.

@section Trade-GltfSceneConverter-behavior Behavior and limitations

The plugin recognizes @ref SceneConverterFlag::Quiet, which will cause all
conversion warnings to be suppressed. Both @ref SceneConverterFlag::Quiet and
@ref SceneConverterFlag::Verbose are also translated to corresponding
@ref ImageConverterFlags and propagated to image converter plugins the
converter delegates to.

@subsection Trade-GltfSceneConverter-behavior-meshes Mesh export

-   The @ref MeshData is exported with its exact binary layout. Only padding
    before and after an index view is omitted, the vertex buffer is saved
    verbatim into the glTF buffer. The vertex buffer may get padded with zeros
    at the end to satisfy glTF buffer bounds requirements.
-   @ref MeshPrimitive::Points, @relativeref{MeshPrimitive,Lines},
    @relativeref{MeshPrimitive,LineLoop},
    @relativeref{MeshPrimitive,LineStrip},
    @relativeref{MeshPrimitive,Triangles},
    @relativeref{MeshPrimitive,TriangleStrip} and
    @relativeref{MeshPrimitive,TriangleFan} is supported by core glTF.
    Implementation-specific primitive types can't be exported.
-   Both non-indexed and indexed meshes with @ref MeshIndexType::UnsignedShort
    or @ref MeshIndexType::UnsignedInt are supported by core glTF,
    @ref MeshIndexType::UnsignedByte is supported but discouraged.
    Implementation-specific index types and non-contiguous index arrays can't
    be exported.
-   While glTF has a requirement that vertex / index count corresponds to the
    actual primitive type, the exporter doesn't check that at the moment.
    Attribute-less meshes and meshes with zero vertices are not allowed by the
    spec but @ref GltfImporter supports them and they can be exported with a
    warning if you disable the @cb{.ini} strict @ce
    @ref Trade-GltfSceneConverter-configuration "configuration option".
    Attribute-less meshes with a non-zero vertex count are unrepresentable in
    glTF and thus can't be exported.
-   @ref MeshAttribute::Position in @ref VertexFormat::Vector3 is supported by
    core glTF; @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector3b},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector3bNormalized},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector3ub},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector3ubNormalized},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector3s},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector3sNormalized},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector3us} or
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector3usNormalized} will be exported with
    [KHR_mesh_quantization](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_mesh_quantization/README.md)
    being added to required extensions. Other formats or 2D positions are not
    supported.
-   @ref MeshAttribute::Normal in @ref VertexFormat::Vector3 is supported by
    core glTF; @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector3bNormalized} and
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector3sNormalized} will be exported with
    [KHR_mesh_quantization](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_mesh_quantization/README.md)
    being added to required extensions. No other formats are supported.
-   @ref MeshAttribute::Tangent in @ref VertexFormat::Vector4 is supported by
    core glTF; @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector4bNormalized} and
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector4sNormalized} will be exported with
    [KHR_mesh_quantization](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_mesh_quantization/README.md)
    being added to required extensions. No other formats are supported.
    Three-component tangents and separate bitangents will be exported as a
    custom `_TANGENT3` / `_BITANGENT` attributes under rules that apply to
    custom attributes as described below.
-   @ref MeshAttribute::TextureCoordinates in @ref VertexFormat::Vector2,
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector2ubNormalized} and
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector2usNormalized} are supported by core glTF.
    The data are by default Y-flipped unless the
    @cb{.ini} textureCoordinateYFlipInMaterial @ce
    @ref Trade-GltfSceneConverter-configuration "configuration option" is
    enabled. @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector2b},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector2bNormalized},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector2ub},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector2s},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector2sNormalized} or
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector2us} will be exported with
    [KHR_mesh_quantization](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_mesh_quantization/README.md)
    being added to required extensions. Those can't be Y-flipped and thus
    require the @cb{.ini} textureCoordinateYFlipInMaterial @ce option to be
    explicitly enabled. Other formats are not supported.
-   @ref MeshAttribute::Color in @ref VertexFormat::Vector3 /
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector4},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector3ubNormalized} /
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector4ubNormalized} and
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector3usNormalized} /
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector4usNormalized} are supported by core glTF.
    No other formats are supported.
-   @ref MeshAttribute::JointIds in @ref VertexFormat::UnsignedByteNormalized
    and @ref VertexFormat::UnsignedShortNormalized are supported by core glTF.
    glTF allows 32-bit integers only for index types, exporting
    @ref VertexFormat::UnsignedInt is possible with a warning if you disable
    the @cb{.ini} strict @ce
    @ref Trade-GltfSceneConverter-configuration "configuration option". The
    attribute is required to have the array size divisible by four, each
    group of four elements is then exported as one attribute.
-   @ref MeshAttribute::Weights in @ref VertexFormat::Float,
    @ref VertexFormat::UnsignedByte and @ref VertexFormat::UnsignedShort are
    supported by core glTF. No other formats are supported. The attribute is
    required to have the array size divisible by four, each group of four
    elements is then exported as one attribute.
-   @ref MeshAttribute::ObjectId in @ref VertexFormat::UnsignedByte and
    @ref VertexFormat::UnsignedShort is exported as `_OBJECT_ID` by default,
    use the @cb{.ini} objectIdAttribute @ce
    @ref Trade-GltfSceneConverter-configuration "configuration option" to
    change the identifier name. glTF allows 32-bit integers only for index
    types, exporting @ref VertexFormat::UnsignedInt is possible with a warning
    if you disable the @cb{.ini} strict @ce
    @ref Trade-GltfSceneConverter-configuration "configuration option".
-   Custom attributes are exported with identifiers set via
    @ref setMeshAttributeName(), and unless the custom attribute corresponds to
    a builtin glTF attribute, the name should be prefixed with a `_` to adhere
    to the spec. If no name was set for an attribute, it's exported with an
    underscore followed by its numeric value extracted using
    @ref meshAttributeCustom(MeshAttribute). Allowed formats are
    @ref VertexFormat::Float, @relativeref{VertexFormat,Byte},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,ByteNormalized},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,UnsignedByte},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,UnsignedByteNormalized},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Short},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,ShortNormalized},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,UnsignedShort},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,UnsignedShortNormalized}, its 2-, 3- and
    4-component vector counterparts, @relativeref{VertexFormat,Matrix2x2},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Matrix2x2bNormalizedAligned},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Matrix2x2sNormalized},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Matrix3x3},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Matrix3x3bNormalizedAligned},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Matrix3x3sNormalizedAligned},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Matrix4x4},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Matrix4x4bNormalized} and
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Matrix4x4sNormalized}. Exporting
    @ref VertexFormat,UnsignedInt,
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector2ui},
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector3ui} and
    @relativeref{VertexFormat,Vector4ui} is possible with a warning if you
    disable the @cb{.ini} strict @ce
    @ref Trade-GltfSceneConverter-configuration "configuration option". Signed
    32-bit integers, half-floats, doubles or packed types are not representable
    in glTF, implementation-specific vertex formats can't be exported.
-   @ref MeshAttribute::TextureCoordinates, @ref MeshAttribute::Color, (custom)
    `JOINTS` and `WEIGHTS` attributes are suffixed with `_0`, `_1`, ... for
    each occurence. Second and following occurences of other attributes are
    prefixed with an underscore if not already and suffixed with `_1`, `_2`,
    ..., so e.g. a second position attribute becomes `_POSITION_1`.
-   Mesh name, if passed, is saved into the file. Additionally the buffer views
    and accessors referenced by it will be annotated with mesh ID and name if
    the @cb{.ini} accessorNames @ce @ref Trade-GltfSceneConverter-configuration "configuration option"
    is enabled.
-   Due to a material and a mesh being tied together in a glTF file, meshes
    that are referenced by a scene are written in the order they are referenced
    from @ref SceneData. They and get duplicated (including the name) if the
    same mesh gets used with different materials, but their vertex and index
    data stay shared. If multiple meshes are assigned to a single object, a
    glTF multi-primitive mesh is formed of them. In that case the name is
    preserved only if all meshes referenced by the object have the same. Meshes
    that were not referenced by any scene are written at the end, without any
    material assignment.
-   At the moment, alignment rules for vertex stride are not respected.
-   In some cases it might happen that the official Khronos glTF validator
    will warn about `min` / `max` accessor bounds very slightly differing from
    the calculated values. This is a known issue due to the
    [validator floating-point comparison being overly strict](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Validator/issues/173).

@subsection Trade-GltfSceneConverter-behavior-images Image and texture export

-   Images are converted using a converter specified in the
    @cb{.ini} imageConverter @ce
    @ref Trade-GltfSceneConverter-configuration "configuration option",
    propagating flags set via @ref setFlags(). An @ref AbstractImageConverter
    plugin manager has to be registered using
    @relativeref{Corrade,PluginManager::Manager::registerExternalManager()}
    for image conversion to work. Options for a particular converter are meant
    to be set globally via
    @relativeref{Corrade,PluginManager::Manager::metadata()} through the image
    converter manager.
-   By default, images are saved as external files for a `*.gltf` output and
    embedded into the buffer for a `*.glb` output. This behavior can be
    overriden using the @cb{.ini} bundleImages @ce
    @ref Trade-GltfSceneConverter-configuration "configuration option" on a
    per-image basis.
-   Core glTF supports only JPEG and PNG file formats, other formats are
    available via extensions:
    -   WebP can be saved with the [EXT_texture_webp](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_texture_webp/README.md)
        extension
    -   KTX2 files with a LDR 2D ASTC block-compressed formats can be saved
        with the [EXT_texture_astc](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Vendor/EXT_texture_astc/README.md)
        extension by setting @cb{.ini} imageConverter=KtxImageConverter @ce
    -   Basis-encoded KTX2 files can be saved with the
        [KHR_texture_basisu](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_texture_basisu/README.md)
        extension by setting @cb{.ini} imageConverter=BasisKtxImageConverter @ce
    The [MSFT_texture_dds](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Vendor/MSFT_texture_dds/README.md)
    extension is not exported because there's currently no image converter
    capable of saving DDS files. Other formats (such as TGA, OpenEXR...) are
    not supported by the spec but @ref GltfImporter supports them and they can
    be exported if the @cb{.ini} strict @ce
    @ref Trade-GltfSceneConverter-configuration "configuration option" is
    disabled. Such images are then referenced directly without any extension.
-   If the @cb{.ini} experimentalKhrTextureKtx @ce
    @ref Trade-GltfSceneConverter-configuration "configuration option" is
    enabled, generic KTX2 images can be saved with the proposed
    [KHR_texture_ktx](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/pull/1964)
    extension.
-   Image and texture names, if passed, are saved into the file. Additionally
    the buffer views referenced by embedded images will be annotated with image
    ID and name if the @cb{.ini} accessorNames @ce
    @ref Trade-GltfSceneConverter-configuration "configuration option" is
    enabled.
-   The texture is required to only be added after all images it references
-   At the moment, there's no support for exporting multi-level images even
    though the KTX2 container is capable of storing these.

@subsubsection Trade-GltfSceneConverter-behavior-images-array 2D array texture export

If the @cb{.ini} experimentalKhrTextureKtx @ce
@ref Trade-GltfSceneConverter-configuration "configuration option" is enabled,
the plugin supports also 3D images and 2D array textures using a proposed
[KHR_texture_ktx](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/pull/1964) extension.

-   Only KTX2 images are supported for 3D, i.e. with either
    @cb{.ini} imageConverter=KtxImageConverter @ce or
    @cb{.ini} imageConverter=BasisKtxImageConverter @ce. They need to have
    @ref ImageFlag3D::Array set.
-   Use a @ref TextureType::Texture2DArray texture to reference the 3D images.
    Due to how the extension is designed, the resulting glTF then has the
    texture duplicated for each layer of the image; @ref GltfImporter then
    @ref Trade-GltfImporter-behavior-textures-array "undoes the duplication again on import".
-   Due to how the extension is designed, the presence of the texture
    referencing the 3D image is *essential* for properly recognizing the image
    as 3D on import. Without it, the image gets recognized as 2D and the import
    will subsequently fail due to the image file not actually being 2D.
-   A material referencing a 2D array texture implicitly uses the first
    (@cpp 0 @ce) layer. Use the `*TextureLayer` attributes (such as
    @ref MaterialAttribute::BaseColorTextureLayer for a
    @ref MaterialAttribute::BaseColorTexture) to specify a layer. The layer
    index has to be smaller than the Z dimension of the image.

@subsection Trade-GltfSceneConverter-behavior-materials Material export

-   Implicitly, only attributes that are different from glTF material defaults
    are written to save file on size. Enable the @cb{.ini} keepMaterialDefaults @ce
    @ref Trade-GltfSceneConverter-configuration "configuration option" to
    write them as well.
-   Both a separate @ref MaterialAttribute::MetalnessTexture and
    @ref MaterialAttribute::RoughnessTexture as well as a combined
    @ref MaterialAttribute::NoneRoughnessMetallicTexture is supported, but
    either both or neither textures have to be present and have to satisfy glTF
    packing rules as described in
    @ref PbrMetallicRoughnessMaterialData::hasNoneRoughnessMetallicTexture().
-   @ref MaterialAttribute::NormalTextureSwizzle has to be
    @ref MaterialTextureSwizzle::RGB, if present;
    @ref MaterialAttribute::OcclusionTextureSwizzle has to be
    @ref MaterialTextureSwizzle::R, if present.
-   If @ref MaterialType::Flat is present, the
    [KHR_materials_unlit](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_unlit/README.md)
    extension is included in the output. If
    @ref MaterialType::PbrMetallicRoughness is present, the output material has
    the `pbrMetallicRoughness` material property object written even if it
    would be empty in order to make @ref GltfImporter import the material with
    @ref MaterialType::PbrMetallicRoughness set again. Without the type
    present, the `pbrMetallicRoughness` object is written only if non-empty.
    Other @ref MaterialTypes are ignored, the material is only filled based on
    the attributes present.
-   If @ref MaterialLayer::ClearCoat is present, the
    [KHR_materials_clearcoat](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_materials_clearcoat/README.md)
    extension is included in the output.
-   If any
    @ref MaterialAttribute::BaseColorTextureMatrix "MaterialAttribute::*TextureMatrix"
    attributes are present, the [KHR_texture_transform](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/blob/main/extensions/2.0/Khronos/KHR_texture_transform/README.md)
    extension is included in the output. At the moment, only offset and scaling
    is written, rotation is ignored with a warning. If the
    @cb{.ini} textureCoordinateYFlipInMaterial @ce
    @ref Trade-GltfSceneConverter-configuration "configuration option" is
    enabled, all material textures will contain an Y-flip transformation in
    addition to any existing transformation.
-   Material names, if passed, are saved into the file
-   The material is required to only be added after all textures it references,
    in case of @ref Trade-GltfSceneConverter-behavior-images-array "2D array textures"
    it's also required to reference only existing layers
-   An informational warning is printed for all attributes that were unused
    due to not having a glTF equivalent, due to referring to a texture but the
    texture attribute isn't present or due to the support not being implemented
    yet. The only exception is Phong @ref MaterialAttribute::DiffuseColor and
    @relativeref{MaterialAttribute,DiffuseTexture} attributes if they match the
    corresponding @ref MaterialAttribute::BaseColor /
    @relativeref{MaterialAttribute,BaseColorTexture} attributes. Such
    attributes are produced by @ref GltfImporter for compatibility purposes
    when the @cb{.ini} phongMaterialFallback @ce @ref Trade-GltfImporter-configuration "configuration option"
    is enabled and are redundant.
-   Custom material attributes and layers are exported in a way inverse to
    @ref Trade-GltfImporter-behavior-materials "what GltfImporter does", with
    the intent to fully preserve yet-unrecognized extensions and material
    extras if an imported glTF file is exported back:
    -   Custom attributes (i.e., ones not starting with an uppercase letter)
        in the base layers are written to glTF `extras` object in the material
    -   Custom layers with a name that start with a `#` are assumed to be glTF
        extensions and are written to glTF `extensions` object in the material,
        with the layer name (except the `#`) used as extension name. Other
        custom layers and unnamed layers are ignored with a warning.
    -   @ref MaterialAttributeType::String,
        @relativeref{MaterialAttributeType,Bool}
        and @relativeref{MaterialAttributeType,Float} are exported as-is,
        @relativeref{MaterialAttributeType,UnsignedInt},
        @relativeref{MaterialAttributeType,Int},
        @relativeref{MaterialAttributeType,UnsignedLong} and
        @relativeref{MaterialAttributeType,Long} are converted to a JSON
        double-precision number. @relativeref{MaterialAttributeType,Deg} and
        @relativeref{MaterialAttributeType,Rad} are exported as a plain number,
        losing their original unit
    -   @ref MaterialAttributeType::Vector2,
        @relativeref{MaterialAttributeType,Vector3} and
        @relativeref{MaterialAttributeType,Vector4} are exported as numeric
        arrays, @relativeref{MaterialAttributeType,Vector2ui},
        @relativeref{MaterialAttributeType,Vector2i},
        @relativeref{MaterialAttributeType,Vector3ui},
        @relativeref{MaterialAttributeType,Vector3i},
        @relativeref{MaterialAttributeType,Vector4ui} and
        @relativeref{MaterialAttributeType,Vector4i} are converted to arrays of
        JSON double-precision numbers.
    -   Custom attributes inside extension layers that end with `*Texture`
        and are @ref MaterialAttributeType::UnsignedInt are recognized as
        texture references and written as a glTF [textureInfo](https://www.khronos.org/registry/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#reference-textureinfo)
        objects, with corresponding `*TextureLayer` attributes (if they are
        @ref MaterialAttributeType::UnsignedInt) then recognized as
        @ref Trade-GltfSceneConverter-behavior-images-array "2D array texture layers",
        `*TextureCoordinates` (if @ref MaterialAttributeType::UnsignedInt) as
        coordinate index and `*TextureMatrix` (if
        @ref MaterialAttributeType::Matrix3x3) as a texture matrix. Layer-local
        and global fallback to @ref MaterialAttribute::TextureLayer,
        @relativeref{MaterialAttribute,TextureCoordinates} and
        @relativeref{MaterialAttribute,TextureMatrix} applies to the custom
        attributes as well. The texture ID and layer attributes are
        bounds-checked against existing textures and layer count of existing
        textures and the whole texture is ignored with a warning if either of
        the two is outside of the bounds. If any of these has an unexpected
        type, it's ignored with a warning.
    -   `*Texture` and related attributes inside the base layer (as opposed to
        custom layers) have no special handling, so they'll be exported as
        numbers. `*Texture`-related attributes inside extension layers that
        have no base `*Texture` attribute are ignored with a warning.
    -   @ref MaterialAttributeType::Pointer,
        @relativeref{MaterialAttributeType,MutablePointer} and
        @relativeref{MaterialAttributeType,Buffer} attributes are ignored with
        a warning.
    -   Custom @ref MaterialAttributeType::TextureSwizzle attributes are always
        ignored with a warning, as glTF doesn't have a builtin way to describe
        a texture swizzle. (In contrast, builtin @ref MaterialAttributeType::TextureSwizzle
        attributes are used to check if given texture is compatible with the
        layout glTF expects or potentially used to pick a glTF extension that
        enables support for given swizzle.)
    -   @ref MaterialAttributeType::Matrix2x2 and other matrix attributes,
        except for @ref MaterialAttribute::TextureMatrix as described above,
        are ignored with a warning. While they could be flattened to JSON
        arrays as well, it's impossible to know whether they're a vector or a
        matrix on import and so they're not exported at the moment because
        @ref GltfImporter wouldn't be able to import them anyway.
    -   Attributes in extension layers starting with an uppercase letter,
        except for @ref MaterialAttribute::TextureLayer,
        @relativeref{MaterialAttribute,TextureCoordinates} and
        @relativeref{MaterialAttribute,TextureMatrix}, are ignored with a
        warning.

@subsection Trade-GltfSceneConverter-behavior-scenes Scene export

-   Only 3D scenes are supported
-   Only objects with a @ref SceneField::Parent entry are exported, all other
    objects are ignored with a warning. This also implies that object IDs are
    not preserved, as otherwise the glTF would contain a lot of empty
    unreferenced node objects.
-   The @ref SceneField::Parent hierarchy is required to be acyclical
-   To satisfy glTF requirements, if both @ref SceneField::Transformation and
    at least one of @relativeref{SceneField,Translation},
    @relativeref{SceneField,Rotation} and
    @relativeref{SceneField,Scaling} is present, only the TRS component(s) are
    saved into the file and not the matrix, assuming the transformation matrix
    is equivalent to them
-   Object and scene names, if passed, are saved into the file
-   The scene is required to only be added after all meshes and materials it
    references
-   Multiple @ref SceneField::Mesh and @ref SceneField::MeshMaterial entries
    per object are turned into multi-mesh primitives. Other duplicate builtin
    fields are ignored with a warning.
-   Custom @ref SceneFieldType::Float, @relativeref{SceneFieldType,UnsignedInt},
    @relativeref{SceneFieldType,Int}, @relativeref{SceneFieldType,Bit} and
    string fields are exported if a name is set for them via
    @ref setSceneFieldName(). Custom fields of other types and without a name
    assigned are ignored with a warning. Fields that have
    @ref SceneFieldFlag::MultiEntry set are exported as arrays, otherwise
    duplicate entries for the same object are ignored with a warning.
-   At the moment, only @ref SceneField::Parent,
    @relativeref{SceneField,Transformation},
    @relativeref{SceneField,Translation}, @relativeref{SceneField,Rotation},
    @relativeref{SceneField,Scaling}, @relativeref{SceneField,Mesh}
    and @relativeref{SceneField,MeshMaterial} is exported, other builtin fields
    are ignored with a warning
-   At the moment, only a single scene can be exported. Default scene index is
    however only written if @ref setDefaultScene() is called.
