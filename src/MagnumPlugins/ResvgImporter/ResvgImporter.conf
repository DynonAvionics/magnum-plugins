# DPI at which to rasterize the file. Default matches what e.g. Inkscape
# uses, and causes SVG viewBox to be interpreted as literal pixels. Setting
# to e.g. 192 makes the image twice as large, 48 half the size. Fractional
# values are accepted as well. Note that the DPI value is used during file
# opening already, changing it afterwards has no effect.
dpi=96

# Resvg takes the SVG colors, which are encoded as 8-bit sRGB values, and
# premultiplies them with the alpha linearly, i.e. not by decoding the sRGB
# value first, then premultiplying and then encoding a sRGB value back. For
# consistency with other formats that produce unpremultiplied RGBA output
# this premultiplication is undone on import. Set to `premultipliedLinear` to
# import directly the pixels produced by Resvg without any processing.
