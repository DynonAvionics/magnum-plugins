@brief SVG importer plugin using resvg
@m_since_latest_{plugins}

@m_keywords{SvgImporter}

Rasterizes Scalable Vector Graphics (`*.svg`) using the
[resvg](https://github.com/linebender/resvg) library. Supports also gzipped SVG
files (`*.svgz`).

This plugin provides the `SvgImporter` plugin.

@m_class{m-block m-success}

@thirdparty This plugin makes use of the
    [resvg](https://github.com/linebender/resvg) library originally by
    [Yevhenii Reizner](https://github.com/RazrFalcon),
    released under either an @m_class{m-label m-success} **Apache-2.0** license
    ([license text](https://github.com/linebender/resvg/blob/main/LICENSE-APACHE),

@section Trade-ResvgImporter-usage Usage

@m_class{m-note m-success}

@par
    This class is a plugin that's meant to be dynamically loaded and used
    through the base @ref AbstractImporter interface. See its documentation for
    introduction and usage examples.

This plugin depends on the @ref Trade library and is built if
`MAGNUM_WITH_RESVGIMPORTER` is enabled when building Magnum Plugins. To use
as a dynamic plugin, load @cpp "ResvgImporter" @ce via
@ref Corrade::PluginManager::Manager.

Additionally, if you're using Magnum as a CMake subproject, bundle the
[magnum-plugins repository](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins) and do the
following. The resvg library is written in Rust and cannot be added as a CMake
subproject so you need to provide it as a system dependency and point
`CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to its installation dir if necessary. Note that in order to
build against it, it has to be a library including the `resvg.h` C header, not
just the self-contained executable alone that's provided in the official
releases.

@code{.cmake}
set(MAGNUM_WITH_RESVGIMPORTER ON CACHE BOOL "" FORCE)
add_subdirectory(magnum-plugins EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

# So the dynamically loaded plugin gets built implicitly
add_dependencies(your-app MagnumPlugins::ResvgImporter)
@endcode

To use as a static plugin or as a dependency of another plugin with CMake, put
[FindMagnumPlugins.cmake](https://github.com/mosra/magnum-plugins/blob/master/modules/FindMagnumPlugins.cmake)
into your `modules/` directory, request the `ResvgImporter` component of the
`MagnumPlugins` package in CMake and link to the `MagnumPlugins::ResvgImporter`
target:

@code{.cmake}
find_package(MagnumPlugins REQUIRED ResvgImporter)

# ...
target_link_libraries(your-app PRIVATE MagnumPlugins::ResvgImporter)
@endcode

See @ref building-plugins, @ref cmake-plugins, @ref plugins and
@ref file-formats for more information.

@section Trade-ResvgImporter-behavior Behavior and limitations

The output is always @ref PixelFormat::RGBA8Unorm and the rasterized size by
default corresponds to what's specified in @cb{.cml} <svg viewBox="..."> @ce.
Use the @cb{.ini} dpi @ce @ref Trade-ResvgImporter-configuration "configuration option"
to rasterize at a different size.

The resvg library only provides very limited error reporting in case an import
fails, so the plugin will almost always print a generic error message. It can
only log to standard error output in a way that cannot be disabled again
afterwards and thus the logging is never enabled by the plugin.

@subsection Trade-ResvgImporter-behavior-external-data External data references

Resvg supports external @cb{.xml} <image> @ce references, but for them to work
the file has to be opened through @ref openFile(). If the referenced file isn't
found, if a SVG with an external reference is parsed via @ref openData() or any
other error occurs, the resvg library silently ignores it without giving any
error or warning, and the output can also contain random pixel values in that
case.

The library also claims to support text rendering, but such feature so far
wasn't explicitly tested in the plugin implementation.

@section Trade-ResvgImporter-configuration Plugin-specific configuration

It's possible to tune various import options through @ref configuration(). See
below for all options and their default values:

@snippet MagnumPlugins/ResvgImporter/ResvgImporter.conf configuration_

See @ref plugins-configuration for more information and an example showing how
to edit the configuration values.
